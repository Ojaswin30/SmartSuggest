# Context-Aware AI Companion

## Overview
This project reimagines the smartphone as more than just a collection of apps — instead, as an intelligent companion that understands *when, where, and how* you use your device.  
By combining app usage history with location data (and potentially environment/mood cues from the camera), the system builds a **personalized log of daily digital behavior**.  
This allows the companion to proactively suggest apps, playlists, or actions tailored to the user’s real-world context.

## Problem
Smartphones today are reactive — they wait for you to open an app. While recommendation engines exist inside apps (like YouTube or Spotify), the operating system itself does not provide **context-aware, cross-app suggestions**.  
There’s no unified system that says:  
- *“You usually open Maps after Gmail when leaving the office at 6 PM”*  
- *“When you’re at the gym, you prefer your Spotify workout playlist”*  

## Solution
Our AI Companion creates **contextual triggers** by analyzing:  
- **App usage logs** – frequency, duration, and sequence of apps.  
- **Location patterns** – recurring places and times.  
- **Environmental/mood cues** *(future scope)* – optional signals from the camera or phone sensors.  

From this, the system learns routines and can suggest the right app or action at the right moment — all while keeping processing local to the device (lightweight + private).

## Novelty
- Goes beyond single-app recommendations → creates **cross-app, context-driven nudges**.  
- Uses **daily behavior logs** in a structured way, not just one-off suggestions.  
- Can evolve into a **multimodal hybrid model**, blending text, vision, and location data.  
- Prioritizes **privacy** by running inference on-device, not in the cloud.

## Example Use Cases
- **Morning Routine:** At 7 AM, auto-suggests Calendar + Weather.  
- **Work Mode:** After Gmail + Slack, suggests Google Docs.  
- **Evening Commute:** Detects you’re leaving office → suggests Maps + Spotify.  
- **Weekend Leisure:** At the gym → suggests fitness app + workout playlist.  

## Vision
The long-term vision is an **untethered, always-on AI companion** — one that not only remembers your digital habits but *anticipates your needs* in real time, without needing constant internet or manual input.
